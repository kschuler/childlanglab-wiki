# Experiment Training Protocol

> last updated: June 22, 2018

The training protocol for our lab requires each RA to complete the following tasks (in order):

1. Be a participant in the training study, run by the lab manager
2. Watch a child subject be run in the training study, run by the lab manager
3. Run the lab manager as a pretend child subject and get feedback from the lab manager on performance.
4. Practice running the study on at least 2 other research assistants in the lab (if this option is not available, skip to step 5).
5. Run at least 3 real **adults** in the training study.
6. Run at least 3 real **children** in the training study.
7. Run additional kids as needed (determined by **BOTH** the PI and lab manager) until competency on the paradigm is achieved.

## What determines competency?

Competency means each RA should:
1. Know and complete the pre-study steps (consent form, etc.)
2. Follow the study protocol with precision including:
  * Building rapport with the children
  * Delivering the study instructions accurately **from memory**
  * Conducting the study without confounds (without giving kids the answer, giving unbalanced feedback, etc.)
3. Know and complete the post-study steps (debriefing, payment, etc.)
4. Feel comfortable interacting with the children
