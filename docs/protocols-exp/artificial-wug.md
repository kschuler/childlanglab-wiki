# Artificial Wug (Plural Morph) Protocol

This is the official protocol for the Artificial Wug paradigm (sometimes referred to as the Plural Morph paradigm).  When an experiment is conducted using this paradigm, this protocol should be followed precisely without any modifications.  The protocol for child and adult participants is identical.  

**Any modifications to this protocol must be submitted via the official [modification procedure](#modification-procedure) and must be approved by Kathryn Schuler.**

## Experiment Protocol

The following steps must be carried out exactly for each participant, regardless of whether the participant is a child or adult.  Before running an experiment, be sure to download this protocol as a checklist/data-sheet to follow.

   Order | Protocol
   :---: | ---
   1 | Record the experiment ID and experimenter name
   2 | Retrieve SID number and condition from subject-tracking sheet
   3 | Request consent via consent form; be sure to give participant (or parent) the [official study description](#what-is-the-official-study-description) and an opportunity to ask questions
   4 | Record today's date, the time, and the location
   5 | Begin audio recording
   6 | Place participant under audiophile headphones; check comfort and volume
   7 | CHILDREN ONLY+: Read the child assent script to participant to request verbal assent; give opportunity to ask questions<br><br>*+required for all children at UPenn; required only for children 8+ at Georgetown*
   8 | Begin experiment, entering `SID`, and `condition` from data collected in step 2
   9 | Make an effort to make the participant comfortable with you and your name. <br><br>*"Do you remember my name? It's [insert name]. Do you know anyone else named [insert name]?"*
   10 | Deliver study instructions (exactly as below). <br><br>*"Hello!  Today you are going to learn to speak a new language called Silly Speak. Do you know how to speak any other languages? [pause for response....] Great!  You are going to be super good at learning Silly Speak. You’ll learn Silly Speak by playing a computer game.  The computer game has 3 levels.  In the 1st level, you will practice saying things in Silly Speak.  In the 2nd level you will try to say some things all by yourself in Silly Speak. In the 3rd level you will play a matching game. While you are playing and trying your best you will get to take 6 sticker breaks! At sticker breaks you get to pick a sticker from my sheet.  And at the very end of the game you will get a prize as a thank you for trying your best to learn Silly Speak!  Does that sound good? Ok, let's start level 1."*
   11 | Deliver level 1 instructions (exactly as below). <br><br>*“In level 1 you are going to practice saying things in Silly Speak. You will see a screen like this.  On the bottom of the screen you will see a bar.  On this side, it tells you what level you are on.  And the bar will tell you how much longer the level will last. In level 1, you are going to see a box like this.  Something will appear in the box and you will hear a voice say what is in the box in Silly Speak! Your job is to try to say what is in the box, too!  Try to say it just like the voice did.  Really try to learn how to say what is in the box because you will have to say some by yourself in Level 2! Ok, let’s try it!”*
   12 | Begin level 1 (exposure). Participant must REPEAT every exposure trial; experimenter must advance trails.<br><br>During ALL sticker breaks, deliver the following instructions:<br>*“Great job practicing Silly Speak! It is time for a sticker break!  This is your [insert number] sticker.  There are [insert number] more stickers to get and then the prize bag at the end!  Ready to keep going?  Remember, really try to learn how to say what is in the box because you will have to say some by yourself in Level 2.”*<br><br>**Permitted additional instructions:**<br>*"Ok, let's try the next one."<br>“Remember there are [insert number] stickers to get!  Let’s keep going so you can earn the next one!”*
   13 |  Deliver level 2 instructions (exactly as below).<br>*“Great job on Level 1! Now that you have practiced saying what is in the box in Silly Speak, you are going on to Level 2.  In Level 2, the voice will say what is in the box.  Then new things will appear in the box and you will try to say what is in the box on your own.  Now you are taking turns with the voice.  Let’s try it!”*<br><br>**Permitted additional instructions:**<br>*“Don’t worry, I’ll show you how to do the first one.”*

## FAQs
##### How important is it for me to follow the protocol exactly?
> Extremely important.  In fact, it is so important that if you are unable to conduct the protocol exactly as written, you will not be permitted to run experiments in the lab.

##### What is the official study description?
>"In this study you will learn a made-up language by playing a computer game.  You will see some pictures and hear a sentence that describes the picture in the language.  First you will be asked to repeat the sentence.  After a while, you will be asked to try to describe some pictures in the new language on your own.  At the end of the game you will be asked to judge some sentences in the language."*<br><br>*"Do you have any questions?"

##### Can I still build rapport with the child/adult in ways beyond asking about knowing my name?
> Yes, you may.  However, you must ensure that you specifically ask them about your name (protocol step 8).  This ensures that all experimenters have at least attempted to build rapport and that the participant and experimenter are on a first-name basis.

##### Do I need to ask adults whether they know my name?
> Yes, absolutely.  The protocol must be followed in exactly the same way for both children and adults.

##### Do I need to offer adults stickers?
> Yes, absolutely.  The protocol must be followed in exactly the same way for both children and adults.

##### Can I allow the child to advance trials on their own?  What about adults?
> No and no.  The experimenter must advance all trials in all phases of the experiment. There are no circumstances under which a participant may advance trials

##### In the production test, do I need to say "great job" after every trial?
> Yes, absolutely.

##### In the production test, do I need to say "If this one is gentif [NOUN], how do you say this one?" for every trial?
> Yes, absolutely.

##### In the rating test, can I say "so, you are choosing [number]" after the participant makes a selection?
> No, definitely not.  The only permitted responses are: (1) "I don't know I haven't learned Silly Speak", (2) "It is whatever you think", (3) "Just take your best guess", and (4) "Ok, let's try the next one".  Any other responses are not allowed, as they may unfairly bias the participant's responses.

## Modification Procedure

Order | Protocol
