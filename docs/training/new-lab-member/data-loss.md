## Read: How does the lab protect you against data loss?

### The 3-2-1 Backup


### Specifics
#### Data entered into REDCap
Data entered into REDCap is automatically saved the moment it is entered.

Our REDCap database is housed on the University of Pennsylvania's `redcap.med.upenn.edu` server and is professionally maintained and backed up by UPenn staff.  Our REDCap database is also backed up to the secure `ChildLangLab Cloud`. Data is exported for analysis to our lab's secure Penn+Box (each project has a `deidentified-data` folder for this purpose) which is backed up to the `yellow-brick-road`, an external hard-drive in Katie's office, and to the `ChildLangLab Cloud`.

#### Auto-generated data
We you run an experiment, a folder is automatically created inside the experiment's `data` folder labeled with the experiment id, participant id, and date and time of the study (e.g., 1000-S001-2018-07-07-123455).  Inside this folder, details of the experiment are automatically saved, including which experimental condition was run, what the participant was exposed to, and what test items the participant received.  After the experiment, experimenter's are asked to make a **copy** of this folder and upload it to the `ChildLangLab-confidential-data` folder in our Penn+Box.  

Everything in our secure Penn+Box is backed up to the `yellow-brick-road` and to the `ChildLangLab Cloud`.

#### Uploaded data
In addition to the uploaded copy of an experiment's auto-generated data, experimenters are also required to save any audio or video files associated with a participant to that participant's confidential folder (auto-generated by the experiment, see [Auto-generated data](#auto-generated-data)in the Penn+Box `ChildLangLab-confidential-data` folder.

Once all of a participant's confidential data is saved to the `ChildLangLab-confidential-data` folder, the experimenter is required to upload a copy of the participant's entire **folder** in `ChildLangLab-confidential-data` to the `confidential-data` folder within an individual project (e.g.  `Empirical-Yang`).

As usual, everything in our secure Penn+Box is backed up to the `yellow-brick-road` and to the `ChildLangLab Cloud`.

#### Project files
* folder in Penn+Box

### Versioning Files
* all files on Penn+Box are versioned
* experiment software is versioned using git and stored in a github repository
* analysis files using git and stored on github ? (or BOX?) - figure this out; directly from the redcap database or directly from BOX.

* graduate students, post-docs, and

## Where are the gaps? could you accidentally lose data?

- laptops and iPads (no network connection, lost or stolen)
- uploaded data
  - requires saving: audio files (manually record and save)
  - datasheets need to be filled out and uploaded
  - BOX access priveledges mean you can copy and save data files in unapproved locations.


## What can you do with lab data?
- save in a specified location in the group account; upload to the cloud
    - where can you save things?
-
- I'm a grad student, post-doc, or faculty member, does this still apply to me?  YES. EVERYONE. -->
