## Protecting the rights of child subjects


## Making sure the child feels comfortable

### Make sure the child is comfortable with the space
  -

### Make sure the child is comfortable with you

#### Take some time to get to know them through play and conversation
  - take some time to get to know them;  to play and talk with them; use questions to find out what they know (this will lead to them asking you questions)

#### Build trust between you and the child by being honest
- don't lie and don't be corecive;

#### Reduce power-imbalance by allowing the child as much autonomy as possible
      - ask them where they'd like to sit : the floor is a good choice and I've done that before if a child seems uncomfortable;  
      - allow them to put their own headphones on
      - allow them to use the mouse to drive the computer going forward;
      - allow them to advance the trials whenever possible on computer games
      - allow them to choose their own sticker; allow them to take their time. breaks are for taking a rest and helping the child relax; there is no need to rush them back to the task.
      - allow them to hold the iPad and test out the camera to make sure their parent can see them
      - MORE?
#### Continue to create opportunities for the child to ask you questions

#### Act naturally and engage with them: be confident and matter-of-fact; explain things in a way the child can understand.  make eye-contact (or try to... they might not look at you)

### Make sure the child is comfortable with the research study
    - make sure they are comfortable with the experiment space and that they can picture it
    - don't rush through the assent process; make sure they understand what they are doing and that it is their choice to do it; make sure they know who they can ask if they have questions
    - make sure they know that it is their choice, and not their mom or dads or teachers
    - emphasize that there are no right or wrong answers (assumptions about space and location.)
    - ask them if they have any questions about that

## Additional considerations for offsite experiments:
  - will add tips for implementing the above at offsite locations
  - important additional lab policy: never be alone with them.

Sample scenarios
- child wants to take a rest: i'd say "of course!"
- child seems visibly uncomfortable - i'd ask them if they were uncomfortable; remember your job is protecting their rights as a research subject; some people call these "ethically important moments", if you feel the child is uncomfortable by something they say , give them an opportunity to ask questions, or remind them that they don't have to do the study


- when you were a baby, you didn't know any language, but now you speak and understand English really well. How did you learn it? Do you remember? Was it easy or hard for you?

- chid assent: i'm doing a research study to try to understand how children learn language. In my study, I'm asking kids to learn a pretend language by playing a computer game. Then, I ask them some questions about the language they learned. . But my questions aren't like on a test or on your homework. there are no right or wrong answers to my questions; i just want to know whatever you think!  Sometimes my game is a little bit boring, so we will take lots of breaks so you can rest and choose a sticker.

- his discomfort was observed in Sarah’s nonverbal cues; Sarah avoided eye contact, looked away from the researcher and focused her gaze on the ground, her voice became low and quiet, and she began to speak quickly with hesitation at the end of each sentence.

his was an “ethically important moment” for both researchers, as the tension between collecting important data and respecting the child’s body language regarding her discomfort with disclosure came to a point of tension.







## Before the experiment: Make the child feel comfortable!

All that was to emphasize that the number one absolute very most important thing you can do is to help the child to feel comfortable with you, with the research study, and with the lab space **before** you begin the experiment.  This one thing is so important that it is the difference between the child wanting to participate and the child not wanting to participate, and the difference between collect good data and collecting bad data.

There are a number of reasons why a child might feel uncomfortable with you, the lab space, or the research study.  Some of these actually stem from things you, the researcher, are doing or not doing.  This part of the training is to help you understand what you need to do to make children feel respected and comfortable.   

Instead, focus on making the child as comfortable as you can, and the rest will follow naturally.

### Comfort with the lab space

Your first job as the experimenter is to make sure that the child is comfortable with the lab space.  As mentioned above, this is a new space for them and children might feel uncomfortable because things are unfamiliar to them.  Help the child get familiar by showing them all around the lab space. It is especially important to take the child (with their parent) and to be sure to point them out **to the child**, not the parent.  The parent will get the information by listening to you explain things to the child.

1. **The playroom**: point out the playroom, tell them that this is where kids can play, but also make sure you mention that it is where their parent or carer will be waiting for them while they are in the study.  The more specifically you describe this, the better.  For example:
> "This is our playroom.  We have lots of toys and books that you can play with if you want to. And if you decide you want to be in my research study, your parent or carer will wait right here on this couch for you".

2. **Our office and the other people around**: point out our office and let the child know what the other people around are doing and what their role is.  For example:
> "This room is where the researchers work. They mostly work on computers looking at data or designing computer games for our research studies. Sometimes they also call parents and children to ask if they want to be in our research studies".

3. **The experiment room**: This one is extremely important: show the child around the experiment room itself.  Point out the computer they'll use, the headphones, and anything else you'll use for data collection. Also point out the camera, and let them know that there parent will be able to see them the entire time on the iPad. I like to ask the kid to test the camera with me, so we go back and forth between the playroom and the experiment room.  Let the child hold the iPad so they can see you.

> "Example of what do say"

4. Proximity to parent : Have them try to find the playroom from the expeirment room, so they know exactly where they are in relation to their parent.

4. **The exit**:  Nobody likes to feel trapped somewhere or to feel like they don't know how to leave a situation if they want to.  Point out the exit to the child and let them know the plan for getting them back safely to their car.
> " Do you remember how we came in?  This is the door right here.  When you are ready to leave, your parent or carer will walk you back to the car.  And just in case you don't remember how to get there, I'll walk you out."

5. **The bathroom**: Similarly, children sometimes realize they need to use the bathroom, but might not feel comfortable telling you that or asking you where the bathroom.  This can be a source of discomfort for them.
> "If you have to use the bathroom while you are here, there is one right over there.  If you'd like to use it, you can just tell me and we can pause for a little while."

#### Comforte with the research study

Now that oriented the child to the space, you can
#### You didn't make them comfortable with the experiment room and instruments
In addition to showing the child the playroom, the general exit, the bathroom, and our office space, another often overlooked aspect is showing children the experiment room and the data collection instruments.  Don't leave anything up to the child's imagination - show them exactly what things look like and where they are, so they understand when you describe the study later.


### Comfort with location

* take them to the study room, and make sure they know how to get back to the playroom (where they're parent will be if they want to).
Let's explore some of the reasons a child might feel uncomfortable will you and how you can avoid this.

#### 1. You didn't take a minute to play with them first
Let the child get acclimated to the space by playing for a little while.  While they are playing, join them!  Get on the floor and play, too. This makes it clear to the child that you interested in them and that you are a friendly, nice person.

#### 2. You lied to them
A common misconception is that we need to "get the kid to do the task" by telling them it is a "super-fun computer game" or something similar. This is wrong for two important reasons: (1) it's coercive (see the section on protecting child subjects) and (2) it makes them feel wary of you and uncomfortable with you.  They feel uncomfortable because you told them the game would be fun, then they started playing the game and realized it isn't fun at all.  In other words, you lied. Now, they either think you (1) don't understand kids (and/or fun) or (2) that you were trying to trick them into doing the study. Either way, this isn't good.  They see you as untrustworthy and they are generally generally uneasy about untrustworty people.

Instead, be honest with them about what will happen.  For one thing, you're required to be based on our procedures for [protecting child subjects](../protection-of-children.md).  For another, being honest is a way of respecting them and building trust, which is the best way to make the child feel comfortable with you.  For example, if the child asks you about the game, be honest about how fun it is:

> "Sometimes it is a little bit boring, so we will take some breaks to rest and get a sticker every now and then."







## Sample visit
### A sample in-lab visit
### A sample off-site visit







- Have you been to our lab before? Oh great, well thanks so much for coming.  Let me show you around.  This is our play room.  It is also where parents and carers wait for their children while they are doing the research study. this is our research room, where our research team does their work.  Usually they are reading about science or looking at data.  And this is our experiment room.  This is where my study is. point out the camera; let them test it out.

making the child feel comfortable in the space, with you, and with parental or trusted adult proximity
	- common misconceptions
			- OFFSITE: don't be alone with them; ask the lab manager to discuss this with the off-site location to ensure both you and the children feel comfortable with the environment you are in.



            <!-- ## Put yourself in the child's shoes

            To help you understand the kinds of things you need to do to make a child feel comfortable at our lab, think about how you might feel as a child participant in one of our research studies.  

            * **How would you wind up coming to our lab?**  Likely your parent or carer decided to volunteer you as a research participant. They might have asked you if you wanted to be in the research study, or the they might not have.

            * **How would you feel navigating to our lab?**  As a kid, you probably got in the family car or otherwise followed your parent or carer to the lab. Your parent might have told you that you are coming to the University of Pennsylvania, or that you're going to be in a research study, but you might not know what that means.  It might be your first time coming to a University campus and/or your first time participating in a research study.  If it's your first time, you might be trying to figure out what a research study is.  Maybe you'll draw on the way children's media portrays research or scientist - you might wonder if we are mad scientists, or if we are going to do weird or scary experiments on you.  Maybe you asked your parent or carer about this, or maybe you didn't.  Regardless, you might be feeling a little nervous.

            * **How would you feel when you arrive to our lab?** Even if your parent helped you to understand what is happening and got you excited about coming to the lab, you might start feeling a little nervous when you arrive. A good way to visualize this is recall how you've felt when you've traveled someplace new.  It's a little disorienting and you feel a little nervous because you don't know where you are. Why is that? Well, it's a new place with new people, and maybe it doesn't line up with what you are expecting.  You might feel a little uneasy because it's nothing like you thought, and now you don't know at all what to expect. You are feeling understandably uncomfortable with this new person and the new place you are in. -->

            Children may have never participated in research before, so they might have a hard time understanding what you mean when you describe the study.  They might feel uncomfortable or uneasy because they don't understand what is happening.  A great solution is to SHOW the child what to expect.  Take them on a tour, show them the study room, have everything set up.  Say "You'd sit here and I'd sit here.  There is the computer and the headphones you'd wear to hear the sounds of the computer game. This is our camera so your parent or carer can see and hear everything we are doing.  Do you want to test it out to see if it works? have a hard time understanding what you mean; show them!  

            Take them back to the waiting room and then describe the study. --> -->
