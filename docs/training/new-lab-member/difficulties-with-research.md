## Read: research difficulties in our lab

### How do the research difficulties discussed in the video manifest in our lab?
- Behavior is complex
- Variation
  - within individuals (same person can give 2 very different measurements)
  - between  individuals (the way the you respond might be completely different than the way someone else does)

### How do we reduce the influence of these difficulties?
  These problems are always there, but we can be aware of them to try to reduce their influence to get more accurate date.
  		- Awareness of variation and what we do about it.
  			- keep the study as consistent as possible between groups. If we give children stickers, we also have to give them to adults.
  			- keep instructions as consistent as possible between participants (adults and kids), don't explain the rating scale one way to one person and a completely different way to another (more on this in the "avoiding bias").
  			- individual: multiple trials and average.
  			- normalize data after it is collected. Instead of comparing raw, compare normalized so that we reduce the variation.reaction times, rating scales; we can normalize their rating
  		- Awareness of demand characteristics:
  			- framing of the experiment:
  			- sitting in the room with the participant:
  			- participant bias : designing the rating test.
  		- awareness that any changes have an influence
  			- multiple conditions in experiments and compare them. Thus any changes above and beyond are due to the variable we are manipulating an dnot just the specific content of the experiment.

### What do you need to do?
1. Pass this training.
2. Follow the lab's protocols explicitly
3. Read about experimenter bias to find out the things you can do to ensure you don't inadvertantly introduce a confounding variable. -->
