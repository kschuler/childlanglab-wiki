#### Questions to consider
1. **Informed consent**: What does informed consent mean?  Do we have to tell the participant everything about the study before participating?
2. **Freedom from coercion**: What does coercion mean? What kinds of things might be coercive to a human subject?
3. **Right to be fully informed**: What does the right to be fully informed mean? How do researchers go about doing this?

### Participant rights
#### Right to provide informed consent

Informed consent means that participants are informed about the research study, that they understand the risks associated with the study, and they agree to participate in the study.  In our lab, we use a [consent form to obtain informed consent](https://upenn.box.com/s/zj6z7artpeuecub66ov46qqmgrw2omt9).

Below is an excerpt from our consent form.  Notice that we describe, in plain language, what we are studying and what the participant will do in the study, but we are careful not to give the participant any specific details about the precise research questions we are investigating.  We want the participant to be informed about what they'll be doing and what the risks are, but we do not want to create any [confounds or biases](./avoiding-bias.md) by telling them too many details about the particulars of the study before they take part.

> **What we are studying**: We are studying how people learn languages and the ways in which their ability to do so changes with age.

> **What you will do**: You will be invited to play a 20 to 30-minute computer game in which you will be exposed to a made-up language or pattern that we have devised in our lab. During the game, you will be asked to respond (by pressing a button or speaking) to simple questions about the language or pattern you are learning. You will play the game in one session, though we may invite you to play in up to 3 additional sessions

We also remind the participant that participation is voluntary and that they can stop participating at any time.  This means that if a participant says they want to stop participating at any point during the study, we should stop the study right away, even if we are right in the middle of an experiment.

> **Ending your participation**: You can choose whether or not to participate in this study. If you decide to participate now but change your mind later, you may withdraw from the study at any time without any negative consequences.

> **Your rights**: Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You may decline to participate or withdraw from the study at any time without any negative consequences.

Please read over the [informed consent document](https://upenn.box.com/s/zj6z7artpeuecub66ov46qqmgrw2omt9) carefully and ask questions if there is something you don't understand.  You'll be using this consent form to provide informed consent to our participants, so it is very important that you understand it very clearly.

#### Right to have freedom from coercion

Freedom from coercion means that participation should be unequivocally voluntary; our participants shouldn't feel at all pressured or coerced into participating in a study that they otherwise wouldn't have. Things that might make a participant feel coerced include:

* Being offered too large an incentive (e.g., $1000 for a 5-minute study)
* Being asked to participate by a friend or family member
* Being goaded into participating (e.g., "Come on, it'll just take 5 minutes"; "It'll be super-fun I promise!")
* Being asked to participate by a teacher or other authority figure
* Being offered an incentive that is contingent on completing the study

To ensure freedom from coercion, we offer small incentives (like $10 or course credit); we pay our participants even if they choose to withdraw from the study; we never ask anyone we have a personal or professional relationship with to participate in our research; and we never goad or try to convince participants to agree to participate, or to agree to continue to participate if they've expressed that they want to withdraw.

#### Right to understand the risks & benefits
Our studies fall into a special category called "no more than minimal risk".  This means that the risks associated with participating in our research are very small. Still, we must make an effort to minimize these risks and to explain this to our participants. We describe the risks and benefits on our consent form.

> **Risks**: No known risks are associated with this study other than the potential for mild boredom. We minimize this risk by making our studies as engaging as possible so that they are fun for most people.

> **Benefits**: Participating in this study will not benefit you directly. You may enjoy contributing to the study of language and cognitive science.

#### Right to confidentiality
Participants have the right to have any data collected about them remain confidential.  In our lab, we collect a few kinds of data that are considered confidential including: the participant's name, contact information, and date of birth; as well as audio or video recordings of the participant during the study.

To ensure this sensitive data is kept confidential, we follow a specific data management plan.  Participant's are informed about our plan to keep their data safe and how we might use the data we collect in the informed consent document they sign:

> **Confidentiality**: In order to keep your information safe, the data that we collect is separated from your name and coded with an index number.  The mapping between this index number and your name will be stored separately from the data in a password-protected encrypted database. Identifiable information is never shared with anyone outside our research team.

> **Data use**: We may share your anonymized data with approved members of our research team, but your name and date of birth will never be associated with any data that is shared.  The overall results of this study may be published in scientific journals or discussed at academic conferences, but will never include your name, date of birth, or any other personal identifying information

It is very important that we uphold the promises we made to keep each participant's data safe. You'll learn about the lab's data management plan and how to keep participant data confidential in Part II of the training.

#### Right to be fully informed about the research
Participants have the right to be fully informed about the research they participate in.  In our research, we can't inform participants of exactly what we are researching **before** they participate, because doing so might [bias](./avoiding-bias.md) them or influence how they perform the study.  Instead, we inform the participants of the exact nature of the research **after** the study. Informing the participant after the study is known as debriefing the participant.

In our lab, we create a debriefing document for each study we conduct that fully informs the participant about the research study.  After participating, we read this document to the participant (and in some cases, hand a physical copy to them).

### Who ensures that we are conducting ethical research and protecting human subjects?

As the primary investigator (PI), it is my responsibility to ensure that our lab is conducing ethical research and protecting human subjects.  I do this in a few specific ways:

(1) I submit the details of our research studies to the University of Pennsylvania's Institutional Review Board (IRB).  The IRB is an independent committee that oversees the protection of human subjects. I submit every aspect of our research studies for IRB approval, including: my plan for protecting human subjects (recruitment procedures, consenting procedures, etc), the nature of our research studies  (the purpose and methods, etc), my plan for protecting the confidential data we collect, and any and all documents we provide or read to our participants. I also submit the credentials of lab members who will work on the research for IRB approval.

(2) I make sure that we are following the plan I've submitted to the IRB and that we are protecting human subjects and their data in the ways that I promised we would.  This means it is my responsibility to train lab members on our lab's policies and to ensure that all lab members continue to follow these policies after their training ends.

### What do you need to do as a new lab member?
1. Pass this training
2. Ensure that you obtain informed consent from all participants (consent form)
3. Ensure that participation in the study remains voluntary for the participant.
4. Ensure participants have not be coerced into participating
5. Ensure that participants understand the risks and benefits of participating (consent form)
6. Keep our participant's data safe (you'll learn how in Part II of the training)
7. Ensure that participants are fully informed about the research **after** the study by providing them with a debriefing.
8. Let me (the PI) know if you are concerned that participants in our research are not being afforded the rights outlined above.
