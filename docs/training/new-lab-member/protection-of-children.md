# 1.2 Protection of Children
 > last updated: July 4, 2018 by Kathryn Schuler

<!-- toc -->


To begin, let's watch a video made for children who participated in a clinical research study. I selected this video because it is a beautiful example of how researchers should talk to children about participating in research. In fact, this video was created based on input from children, who described how they would like to be informed about research. After watching, we will discuss how the researchers describe the study to the children and how we try to implement similar practices in our lab.

 > "This animation is for children and young people who have taken part in research when they were very poorly. It helps to explain the reasons why consent could not be sought before they took part in the research. This is research without prior consent (also known as deferred consent).  Doctors, nurses and parents may ask children and young people to watch this animation as a way of informing and involving them in decisions about research. Children, researchers, nurses and doctors helped to make this animation with the company Morph. They based the animation on the findings of The Children’s Voices project, which explored the views of 16 children aged 7-15 about research without prior consent.

#### Questions to consider
How did the researchers in the video ensure that the children were afforded the rights we discussed in the [last module](./protection-of-human-subjects)?  Consider especially:
1. **Informed consent**: Did the researchers from the video have informed consent from the parent? from the child?
2. **Freedom from coercion**: How was the study explained to the child?  Did the researchers try to make the study sound interesting or exciting, or otherwise try to convince the child to participate (or participate again)?
3. **Right to be fully informed**: How did the researchers make sure that the child was fully informed about the study?  Do the children know who they can ask if they have questions about the research?  How do the researchers make sure?

### Rights of the parent or guardian
Even before we ask the child whether or not they'd like the participate in our research study, we need the parent's permission to invite the child to participate.  Our lab uses an [informed consent document](https://upenn.box.com/s/pw1y2mgqm7fowat4v6km7lc07jgi0lqc) to obtain this permission from parents. Notice that the parent is also provided with the same participant rights we saw previously, including a clear description of what their child's rights are as a participant. For example (excerpts from consent form):

**The right to informed consent**:

> **What we are studying**: We are studying how children learn languages and the ways in which their ability to do so changes with age.

> **What your child will do**: With your consent, your child will be invited to play a 20 to 30-minute computer game in which they will be exposed to a made-up language or pattern that we have devised in our lab. During the game, your child will be asked to respond (by pressing a button or speaking) to simple questions about the language or pattern they are learning. Your child will play the game in one session, though we may request your permission to invite your child to play in up to 3 additional sessions.

**The right to voluntary participation**:

> **Ending your child’s participation**: You can choose whether or not to allow your child to participate in this study. If you allow your child to participate now but change your mind later, you may withdraw your child from the study at any time without any negative consequences.

> **Your child’s rights**: Participation in this study is entirely voluntary for both you and your child. Your child may decline to participate or withdraw from the study at any time without any negative consequences.

**The right to freedom from coercion**:

> **Compensation**: Your child will receive stickers and a small book for participating in this study. If your child chooses to withdraw during the experiment, your child will still receive these gifts.

**The right to understand the risks and benefits**:

> **Risks**: No known risks are associated with this study other than the potential for mild boredom. We minimize this risk by making our studies as engaging as possible so that they are fun for most children.

> **Benefits**: Participating in this study will not benefit you or your child directly. You and your child may enjoy contributing to the study of language and cognitive science.

**The right to confidentiality**:

> **Confidentiality**: In order to keep information about your child safe, the data that we collect is separated from your child’s name and coded with an index number. The mapping between this index number and your child’s name will be stored separately from the data in a password-protected encrypted database. Identifiable information is never shared with anyone outside our research team.

> **Data use**: We may share your child’s anonymized data with approved members of our research team, but your child’s name and date of birth will never be associated with any data that is shared. The overall results of this study may be published in scientific journals or discussed at academic conferences, but will never include your child’s name, date of birth, or any other personal identifying information.

Before we invite children to participate in any research study, we must have the explicit, written permission from the child's parent or guardian using this [consent form]().  Importantly, consent cannot be granted by  a child's nanny, grandparent, or anyone other than the parent or legal guardian of the child.  

### Rights of the child participant

Children are afforded exactly the same rights as any human subject.  It is our obligation to protect these rights for our child subjects. Because they may be quiet young, special considerations must be made to obtain informed consent, ensure participation is voluntary, and that the child's right to freedom from coercion is not violated.

#### Right to informed consent: child assent

Before we invite a child to participate in any research study, we must ensure that the child knows  why they are being asked to be in our research study, what will happen in the study, and that they have a choice whether or not to participate.  Importantly, we must do so very plainly and in words the child can understand; our [child assent script]() can help you make sure you have protected the child's right to informed consent.

> My name is [researcher’s name].

> **Why are you being asked to be in this research study?**
> Your parent gave me permission to ask you if you would like to be in this study. I am trying to learn more about how kids learn languages, so I’m asking kids to play this computer game where they learn a pretend language.

> **What will happen during the study?**
> During the game, you will learn a pretend language and press some buttons to answer questions about the pretend language. I might also ask you to try to say some words in the pretend language.

> **Do I have to be in the study?**
> If you don’t want to do this experiment you don’t have to. If you start playing the game, you can change your mind and stop playing any time you want.

> Do you have any questions?

> Do you want to be in the study?

Notice that you must give the child an opportunity to ask questions ("Do you have any questions?") and ask them whether or not they want to be in the study ("Do you want to be in the study?").  At our lab, we are not required to collect the child's signature, but we **are** required to obtain verbal assent from the child.  If the child does not want to be in the study, they do not have to be.  

The child also has the right to voluntary participation.  This means that if the child says they want to stop participating at any point during the study, we should stop the study right away, even if we are right in the middle of an experiment.

#### Right to freedom from coercion

Just like our adult participants, children also have the right to freedom from coercion.  This means that children shouldn't feel at all pressured or coerced to be in a study that they otherwise wouldn't have said yes to. Importantly, things that are coercive to a child may be different than things that are coercive to an adult.  Things that might make a child might feel coerced include:

* Being told they have to participate by a parent or carer, teacher, or researcher
* Being told a parent or career, teacher, or researcher will be hurt or upset if the child doesn't participate.
* Being told that they are bad or naughty if they do not participate or continue participating.
* Being offered a reward that is contingent on completing the study (e.g., "You'll only get the prize at the end if you finish the study.")
* Being offered an additional incentive to continue after they've expressed the desire to withdraw (e.g., "If you finish this part, I'll give you an extra prize at the end")
* Being told things that imply the researcher will think less of the child if they do not participate or continue participating (e.g., "all the other children were able to make it to the end")


Under no circumstances should we ever make a child feel coerced into a study or to completing a study they want to withdraw from. If a child says they want to stop participating at any point during the study, we should stop the study right away, even if we are right in the middle of an experiment.  This can't be overstated.  In [Part 3](), we will talk about ways to make the child feel comfortable with the study and increase the likelihood that a child will want to participate **without** using coercion.


#### Right to be fully informed

Children, like their parents and our adults participants, also have the right to be fully informed about the research study they have participated in.  To ensure this, we (1) give them the same debriefing as adults (which means we ensure the debriefing is simple enough for a child to understand), and (2) make sure the child and their parents know who to ask if they have questions about the research study (you the experimenter or me the PI)

### Who ensures that we are protecting the rights of child subjects?
As with all human subjects, it is my responsibility as primary investigator (PI) to ensure that our lab is conducing ethical research and protecting child subjects.  In addition to (1) submitting our research projects through IRB review and (2)ensuring we follow the plan approved by the IRB, there are specific things I do to ensure child subjects are protected:

(3) I require background checks and fingerprinting from all research assistants working with children.

(4) I enforce a lab-wide policy to **never** be alone with a child.  When with children, research assistants should always be able to be seen by an adult the child trusts.  In our lab, we make this possible by allowing the parent or carer to watch via a live video feed.  Off-site, we make this happen by requested a semi-private space to conduct the experiment, such that we are nearby the center staff and can be seen and heard by other adults; often this is achieved by setting up in an unused office or classroom and leaving the door open so that center staff walking by can see you and the child.

(5) I may revoke your permission to run child subjects at any time and for any reason.  This may happen for example if I feel children are uncomfortable with you based on my subjective opinion after observation.

### what do you need to do?

1. Pass this training
2. Make sure you obtain informed consent from a child's **parent** or **legal guardian** before conducting any research with the child or inviting the child to participate in research.
3. Make sure that participation remains voluntary for the child
4. Make sure you do not coerce children to participate or continue participating
5. Keep children's data safe (you'll learn how in part 2 of the training).
6. Ensure that children are fully informed about the research after the study.
7. Let me (the PI) know if you are concerned that children in our research are not being afforded the rights outlined above.
