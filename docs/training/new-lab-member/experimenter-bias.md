#### Questions to consider:
1. How was Clever Hans able to perform arithmetic? How did researchers make this discovery?  What happened when experimenter bias was removed?
2. What was the twist in the "bright" rats and "dull" rats experiment?  What explains the difference the students observed between these two groups?
3. What kinds of experimenter bias might happen in our research studies? Can you think of some ways to reduce or eliminate experimenter bias?

## Read: experimenter bias in our lab

### How is our lab vulnerable to experimenter bias?
    - we sit in the room with the participant - unconscious cues; just like the rats in the video, you maybe don't even realize you are doing it.
    - we provide feedback to the participant
    - sometimes, even though we try to avoid this, the experimenter knows about the hypothese ahead of time. sometimes the experimenter's expectations can influence what the child does.
    - different experiments might do different non-verbal or verbal things;

### What lab systems do we have to protect against bias and confounds?

- randomization of subject assignment, so you as the experimenter are not aware of which condition the child was run in.
- experimenters are as blind as possible to the language or pattern the child is being exposed to; we have the child wear headphones so the experimenter cannot hear (or at least cannot hear clearly)
- we require you to give the same feedback (verbal) to the child on every trial
- we instruct the experimeneter to interfere with the child as little as possible
- we have an explicit protocol to follow.
- coders and transcribers canâ€™t see what condition the participant was run in.
- we have checks in place so that a supervisor can determine whether or not the protocol was followed and biases and confounds were minimized.


### What are the consequence of experimenter bias in an experiment?
- we will have to re-evaluate all the data, which might result in substantial work for you and the rest of the research team.
- we might have to exclude some or all of the data you've collected because it contains a bias.
- In extreme cases, if the bias is discovered after a paper has already been published, we may need to retract a paper.

In short: tell someone if you have any concerns at all that something you (or any other experimetner) is doing that might be biases the data.  We are a team and are all helping each other protect against these things. You will never get in trouble for pointing out a suspected bias, nor will the experimenter who may have introduced the bias. We are all human and we make mistakes, the point is to point out mistakes as quickly as we can so we can solve the issue.

### What do you need to do as a new lab member?
1. Pass this training
2. Follow the lab's explicit protocols
3. Be very careful to run children and adults in exactly the same way
4. Be very careful to deliver any instructions the same way to every participant
5. If you are supposed to be blind to the experimental condition, don't try to "deduce" what the condition might be, or ask other members of the lab to try to find out. Keep yourself as blind as possible to protect yourself from unconscious bias.
6. Never change the way you are doing something in the middle of experiment without consulting with the entire research team (including and especially the PI)
7. Don't try to convince participants to continue doing the study by changing the way you frame the experiment, direct the participants attention during the experiment, deliver instructions or feedback, or the kinds of rewards the participant receives.
8. When a participant asks for clarification, know how you are permitted to clarify the instructions in the particular study you are conducting.
9. I you feel you may be introducing a bias of some kind, check in with the research team.
10. Don't both run subjects and transcribe; get a person blind to the condition code the experiment.
11. Whenever possible, have two independent coders code your data to ensure reliability. -->
