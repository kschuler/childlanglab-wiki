## Intellectual property
 - Lab Research files (design sheets, change-logs, experiment code, etc.)
 - Property of the lab: Intellectual property (intellectual property research)
   - everything in the lab is copy written - this means that you need EXPLICIT permission to share any of the lab's files outside of the lab.
   - how do I get permission - EVERYONE who owns the IP must grant sharing permission.
     - lab example: artificial languages (IP of the UofR; Elissa Newport); stimuli
     - even I, the PI do not have permission to share files with anyone without getting permission.
 - Penn's rules: https://provost.upenn.edu/policies/faculty-handbook/research-policies/iii-d
 - not just a lab rule; this is a LEGAL obligation and everyone in the lab is bound by it
