## Read: How do we implement the 5 safes in our lab?
### The five safes at the ChildLangLab
safe data - we keep data safe by storing is safely and keeping our data collection machines safe

safe projects - as we learned in the protection of human subjects module, all of our research is approved by the IRB, including the data we collect and the data managagment plan.

safe people - to work one of our projects, you must belong to a trusted institution, pass this training course, and sign something that says you'll keep doing this.

safe settings: our lab  location; locked location for our machines.  some of our machines get to travel. we have to take good care of them to make sure they are not lost or stolen, and lock them up when they are not in use.

safe outputs: data is output by approved individuals with all identifiers removed.  (deductive disclosure); when we share data with our research team, we NEVER share PII, etc.

### What confidential data do we collect?
- PII: only place where name and subjects ID are linked; stored on REDCap.  Access permission levels mean only approved members of the research team have access to the PII, and data accessed from this database has identifiers removed.
- audio and video: record voices or take video of children and adults participating in our research.  Though we don't explicitly ask them any questions that would .  Their voice, their image, or any details they may disclose (we can't control this).  These files are extremely confidential.
- coded data
- datasheets : we write down what happens in the study.  Some questions include where the study was run and what languages the participant speaks. if we ran the child here and they spoke this, they could be identified.
- paper consent forms: contain parent information, child DOB and child name.
- our devices: because we collect PII on our lab machines (laptops and iPads), they are considered to contain confidential information.

### How do we keep these data safe?

Our data management plan.  Where we store the data, what protections are in place, and who is allowed to access what.

you can't take a computer outside the lab;
you can't copy a file to the desktop.
Other people can't use the lab computers, etc.
