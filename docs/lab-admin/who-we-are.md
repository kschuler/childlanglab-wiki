## Our Values

These are the values we share as a lab. We like to articulate them very first, to help us to remember and know what is most important to us.

#### Work-Life Balance
At the Child Language and Learning Lab, we value having lab members who are happy, healthy, and well-rounded people. Having a job you enjoy is important, but we believe that the most important things to you should be yourself and your loved-ones. With that in mind, we try to create an environment that is supportive of you and your loved-ones. For example, we feel strongly that 35 hours per week is plenty of time to get your work done (for full-time staff, post-docs, and graduate students), and we love to hear about and celebrate our lab members accomplishments outside of work.

#### Good Science
It is very important to us that we do good, rigorous empirical research that makes a meaningful contribution to our scientific community. To ensure we do so, we evaluate what we are doing every semester, checking that what we are doing is in keeping with our values.

#### Mentorship
We want our lab members to become good scientists and citizens of the scientific community. We feel strongly that all members of the lab have a responsibility to serve as good examples and mentors for the younger and newer students in the lab. More senior members of the lab should ensure that more junior members feel comfortable asking them for help and advice.

#### Generosity
Along these same lines, we value being generous with our time and resources. We feel it is important to help other members of our lab when they need it and to pass on the knowledge we have acquired to those who are just starting to learn. This generosity also extends to other labs in our department and scientific community. We are happy to help others learn and grow as scientists and are sure to express our gratitude when others have graciously helped us.

#### Simplicity
In our lab, we value simplicity, which means we aim to for our decisions, research, and communications with each other and the outside world to be uncomplicated, not pretentious or obtuse, and easy to understand without unnecessary embellishments.

#### Independence
We think it is important for members of our lab to feel respected as intelligent and hard-working people, capable of working independently and without being micromanaged. We aim to give all lab members plenty of opportunities to work independently and make big contributions to projects going on in the lab.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Lab Members

#### Director
Kathryn Schuler is our lab Director, also known as the Primary Investigator. She likes for everyone in the lab to call her Katie. She's responsible for setting the overall direction of the lab and obtaining the funding to keep us running (grants!). This means that she decides what research projects the lab should work on, oversees those projects, and manages the resources that support them (staff, finances, etc.). Katie also spends a lot of time publishing and presenting the research conducted in the lab, applying for grants, and mentoring the students and research staff. She is the founder of the Child Language and Learning Lab, which was opened in 2017.

#### Post-docs
Post-docs are recent PhD grads who are interested in acquiring additional skills before moving on to faculty positions. They are mentored by Katie and work on mostly independent research projects, publishing their results, and submitting grants. The lab doesn't have post-docs very often, but when we do, they are a great resource for the younger students! Post-docs work full-time in the lab (35 hours per week).

#### Grad Students
Grad students are typically Penn students working toward their PhDs in Linguistics, Psychology, or Computer Science. They are mentored by Katie (sometimes co-mentored by other faculty) and work on somewhat independent research projects, publishing their results, and submitting grants. During the early years of their PhDs, grad students usually have responsibilities outside the lab, including their own coursework or TA-ships; so they work part time in the lab (15-20 hours per week). In later years, graduate students who no longer have these additional responsibilities may work full-time in the lab (35 hours per week).

#### Lab Manager
The lab manager is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the lab. She manages our recruitment efforts,  participate in our studies.  Lauren is here to support the research efforts  Lauren works full time in the lab (35 hours per week).

#### Research Assistants
Research assistants are undergraduate students who are working in the lab to gain research experience. Students can work in the lab for work-study, as student workers (non work-study student employees), for credit (independent study), or as volunteers. Research assistants work in supporting roles on the Support & Operations and/or the Marketing & Recruitment teams. They are also usually assigned a supporting role on one or more research projects (lead by Katie, a post-doc, or a graduate student). During the school year, research assistants work part-time in the lab (10 hours per week). During the summer, research assistants can work full time (up to 35 hours per week).

### Outside Support

#### Program Coordinator for Linguistics
Amy Forsyth is the Program Coordinator for our home department in Linguistics. She manages pretty much everything you can think of for the entire department. She knows everything and is happy to answer questions (she was lab MVP and our unsung hero during our start-up phase). If you need anything from keys, to equipment, to reserving space she is probably the person to go to. Amy is located in the Linguistics Department room 304-CB and her email is aforsyth@ling.upenn.edu.

#### Local Service Provider
Rich King is the Local Service Provider (LSP) for the Linguistics Department. He is basically the computer guru for the entire department (and several other departments) and is the person to contact to solve all of your computing problems. His office is located in FBH 232 and he can be reached at
