## Roles and Responsiblities

> last updated: June 22, 2018

### Director
Kathryn Schuler is our lab Director, also known as the Primary Investigator. She likes for everyone in the lab to call her Katie. She's responsible for setting the overall direction of the lab and obtaining the funding to keep us running (grants!). This means that she decides what research projects the lab should work on, oversees those projects, and manages the resources that support them (staff, finances, etc.). Katie also spends a lot of time publishing and presenting the research conducted in the lab, applying for grants, and mentoring the students and research staff. She is the founder of the Child Language and Learning Lab, which was opened in 2017.

### Post-docs
Post-docs are recent PhD grads who are interested in acquiring additional skills before moving on to faculty positions. They are mentored by Katie and work on mostly independent research projects, publishing their results, and submitting grants. The lab doesn't have post-docs very often, but when we do, they are a great resource for the younger students! Post-docs work full-time in the lab (35 hours per week).

### Grad Students
Grad students are typically Penn students working toward their PhDs in Linguistics, Psychology, or Computer Science. They are mentored by Katie (sometimes co-mentored by other faculty) and work on somewhat independent research projects, publishing their results, and submitting grants. During the early years of their PhDs, grad students usually have responsibilities outside the lab, including their own coursework or TA-ships; so they work part time in the lab (15-20 hours per week). In later years, graduate students who no longer have these additional responsibilities may work full-time in the lab (35 hours per week).

### Lab Manager
The lab manager is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the lab. She manages our recruitment efforts,  participate in our studies.  Lauren is here to support the research efforts  Lauren works full time in the lab (35 hours per week).

### Research Assistants
Research assistants are undergraduate students who are working in the lab to gain research experience. Students can work in the lab for work-study, as student workers (non work-study student employees), for credit (independent study), or as volunteers. Research assistants work in supporting roles on the Support & Operations and/or the Marketing & Recruitment teams. They are also usually assigned a supporting role on one or more research projects (lead by Katie, a post-doc, or a graduate student). During the school year, research assistants work part-time in the lab (10 hours per week). During the summer, research assistants can work full time (up to 35 hours per week).

### Outside Support

#### Program Coordinator for Linguistics
Amy Forsyth is the Program Coordinator for our home department in Linguistics. She manages pretty much everything you can think of for the entire department. She knows everything and is happy to answer questions (she was lab MVP and our unsung hero during our start-up phase). If you need anything from keys, to equipment, to reserving space she is probably the person to go to. Amy is located in the Linguistics Department room 304-CB and her email is aforsyth@ling.upenn.edu.

#### Local Service Provider
Rich King is the Local Service Provider (LSP) for the Linguistics Department. He is basically the computer guru for the entire department (and several other departments) and is the person to contact to solve all of your computing problems. His office is located in FBH 232 and he can be reached at linguistics-help@sas.upenn.edu.
