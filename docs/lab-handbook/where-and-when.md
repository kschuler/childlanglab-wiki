# Where and When we Work

> last updated: June 22, 2018

## Where

Our lab is located in the Linguistics Department at the University of Pennsylvania. The address is: 3401-C Walnut Street, Suite 300, Room 338C, Philadelphia, PA 19104.
Our lab manager and undergraduate research assistants almost always work in our main lab location. Occasionally, the lab manager and research assistants travel to offsite locations (daycares, schools, camps, etc) to recruit subjects and collect data. Graduate students and post-docs are also welcome to work in the main lab space whenever they wish.
Katie's office is located outside the lab in the Linguistics Department, room 314C.
From home
In the Fall 2017 semester, Katie will generally work from home one-day per week from September 01 - November 15. This day will be marked on her calendar and visible to all lab members. After November 15, Katie will be on maternity leave until the start of the Spring semester (January 10th). During this time, she plans to be unavailable for weeks 1-3 of her maternity leave. For the remainder of her leave, she will be available to lab members via basecamp from home.
Post-docs and graduate students are free to work from home whenever they choose to, so long as they are being productive and are engaged with the lab on basecamp.
Occasionally, the lab manager my work from home, but this must be discussed with Katie to ensure the lab can remain open to run subjects when needed.
From shared work spaces
Post-docs and graduate students are also free to work from various other shared work spaces on and off campus. For example, in the shared graduate student office in the linguistics department, in the linguistics department library, in other libraries on campus, or at coffee shops in the area.
